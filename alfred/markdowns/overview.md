⚠️&nbsp; I do not support any kind of piracy and own a personal copy of every movie I watch.

# What is Alfred
## Overview
Alfred is a torrent searcher and a torrent streaming service. It means that with a given movie, Alfred will find the best torrent on an indexer website and will stream it so that you can watch it directly. <br /> Here is a short demo in order to understand how it works : 

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31992334/216135604-9d394073-95eb-4603-a208-7b2506bd594d.mp4" controls="controls" style="max-width: 730px;">
</video>

The movie torrent is not downloaded on the user computer but on an server (that can however be running on the same machine) handling the movie torrent research thanks to indexers sites
and the download/stream of the torrent through [WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-cli). 
The user machine in the video only "asks for" a movie to the server running alfred that returns back an url to the movie file. 

## What I learned
This project has been very instructive and made me learn a ton of competences so far, here are the main ones:
   * Fetch data from websites in python with API calls and html parsing when no API was available.
   * Structure the code in order to improve or add features easily and to avoid bugs hard to resolve.
   * A bit of algorithmic 
   * Create an app in SwiftUI 

## Conclusion
This project brought me a lot but is not finished. I want to open source it the faster, the better and to make a user interfaces for every 
operating system.
